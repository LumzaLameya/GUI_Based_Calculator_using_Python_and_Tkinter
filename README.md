# GUI-based Calculator

A simple GUI-based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
    
- Decimal point support
    
- Clear button to reset the input
    
- Error handling for invalid expressions
    
- Clean and intuitive user interface
    

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
    
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installation)
    

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
    
2. Save the calculator script as calculator.py.
    
3. No additional libraries are required as Tkinter is part of Python's standard library.
    

## Usage

1. Run the script using:
    
    ```
    python calculator.py
    ```
    
2. The calculator GUI will open.
    
3. Click the number and operation buttons to build your expression.
    
4. Press '=' to calculate the result.
    
5. Press 'C' to clear the current expression.
    
6. Invalid expressions will trigger an error message.
    

## File Structure

- calculator.py: Main Python script containing the calculator implementation
    

## Notes

- The calculator uses Python's eval() function for calculations, which safely handles basic arithmetic.
    
- Error handling is implemented to catch invalid expressions.
    
- The GUI is designed to be compact and user-friendly with a fixed window size of 300x400 pixels.
